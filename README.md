# Minesweeper
This is a project submitted to the WGU WinTech Sally Ride Memorial Game Design Hackathon.

This game puts a twist on classic Minesweeper - when you click on a mine, instead of instantly losing,
you are asked a question related to computer science and lose a heart. Once you get the question right, 
you can continue with the Minesweeper puzzle. Be careful though, because you only have 3 hearts, and 
if you run out, it's game over.
